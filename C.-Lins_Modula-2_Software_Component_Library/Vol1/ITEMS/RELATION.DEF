      Initial JPI implementation.

    INTRODUCTION
    This module provides definitions for the standard Modula-2 relations
    and relational operators, along with routines for mapping one type to
    the other, deriving the NOT of a relational operator, and testing for
    a given relational operator implying that another relational operator
    is also true.

(*
    Relation defines the minimum set of relational operators from which all
    others may be derived.  The following equivalent notations should be noted:
	# -> NOT EqualTo
	<= -> NOT GreaterThan
	>= -> NOT LessThan.

    RelOp defines the standard Modula-2 relational operators.
