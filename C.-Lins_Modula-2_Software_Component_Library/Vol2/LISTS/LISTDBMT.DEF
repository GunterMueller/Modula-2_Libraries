Doubly-Linked List Utilities - Interface

In this section is provided a list utilities module for doubly-linked
unbounded lists.  The routines implement such useful list operations as:

Constructors
ù constructing a list from an array of items (Construct and Build),
ù merging two lists
ù inserting an item to the end of a list (AddToTail),

Selectors
ù retrieving the link to the last item of a list (LastOf),
*)

Constructors

Construct builds a list from an array of Items.  If theList is not
empty it is cleared of its contents before the construction commences.
Build is similar except that only the first n items (numItems) are used to
construct the list.

AddToTail adds theItem to the end of theList.  Complexity: O(n).

Split divides theList into two lists at theItem.  If theItem is not present
in theList then the toList is unchanged.

Selectors

LastOf returns the list containing the last item of theList or the NullList
if theList is empty.

PositionOf searches for theItem in theList returning theItem's position such
that:
	Position = 1 when theItem is at the front of theList,
	Position = LengthOf(theList) when theItem is at the end of theList, and
	Position = 0 when theItem is not present within theList.

LocationOf returns a list beginning with the item at theIndex in theList.  If
theList does not have such a positionthe NullList is returned.

PROCEDURE LastOf     (    thePool : Pool     (*-- in    *);
					      theList : List	 (*-- in    *))
	: List     (*-- out   *);

PROCEDURE PositionOf (    theItem : Item     (*-- in    *);
	theList : List     (*-- in    *);
					      thePool : Pool	 (*-- in    *))
							: Position (*-- out   *);

PROCEDURE LocationOf (    theIndex: Position (*-- in    *);
	theList : List     (*-- in    *);
