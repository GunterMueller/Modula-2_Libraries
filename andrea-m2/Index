The files in this directory were contributed by John Andrea,

     Some Modula-2 libraries and example programs developed over several
     years using the Hamburg compiler for VAX/VMS and the Multiscope
     (was Logitech) compiler for MS-DOS.

     Some modules are compiler (or OS ) specific, but many 
     are generic Modula-2 library modules and programs.

     Also included are a few executables.

Please write to John for any questions or suggestions.
