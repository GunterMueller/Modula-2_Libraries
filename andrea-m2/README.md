Below are some Modula-2 libraries and example programs
developed over several years using the Hamburg compiler
for VAX/VMS and the Multiscope (was Logitech) compiler
for MS-DOS (and room for a few other compilers as well).

Some modules are compiler or operating system specific,
but most are generic.
  Don't be afraid to look at all the libraries and examples.


Each directory has a file "a.index" with an overview of
the directory contents.
  The directories are:

applications
  The items here contain real working code.
  Some executables are included.

doc
  Some minor documentation.

examples
  A collection of example programs, and test drivers
  that show how to use and test the modules from
  the "lib" directory.

lib
  This is my a collection of library definition and
  implementation modules.

tools
  This is a collection of some misc. utilities, useful for
  dealing with Modula-2.

A history:
  George vanAudenhove introduced me to Modula-2 in 1982. He had
a PDP-11 compiler that he was trying to use for real-time work.
Unfortunately he never did get that compiler running, but he did pass
his enthuasism on to me.
  At the time I was working at St.Francis Xavier University as the
Academic Programmer and it was clear to me that Modula-2 was the
tool that I needed for systems work, and that it would also be a very
good teaching language. I soon found out about the Univ. of Hamburg
compiler for VMS, for $300US and purchased a copy that summer.
  I installed the compiler and probably became the first Modula-2
programmer in eastern Canada (maybe all of Canada). Interestingly,
some of the code for the compiler was written by Prof. N. Wirth himself.
And thats when I began building this collection.
  St.F.X.U. became the first university in Canada to use Modula-2
as the standard teaching language for Computer Science courses.
  The modules and examples presented here have been used by
students, researchers and system support staff since 1984.
  If you make any use of the code that you find here, your comments are
welcome. If you find any bugs, please let me know.
