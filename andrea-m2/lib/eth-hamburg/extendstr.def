PROCEDURE CaseCompare( a, b :ARRAY OF CHAR; case_specific :BOOLEAN ) :CHAR;
(*
 Compare the two string 'a' and 'b' and return one of the three
 characters '=' '>' or '<'.
 '=' means that the strings are equal,
 '>' means that 'a' is lexigraphically greater than 'b', and
 '<' means that 'a' is less than 'b'

 Set 'case_specific' to TRUE if the comparison requires that
 the characters be of the same case.
*)


PROCEDURE WildcardMatch( string, pattern :ARRAY OF CHAR ) :BOOLEAN;
(*
 Determine if the wildcard string 'pattern' matches 'string'
 Wildcard characters are "*" and "%".
*)
