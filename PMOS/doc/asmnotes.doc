THE *.A FILES

These are in the SOURCES\GENERAL directory, and are for use with
TopSpeed version 3 by people who have the TopSpeed assembler.
They have been tested fairly thoroughly.  They won't, however,
work with any compiler other than TopSpeed version 3.

THE *.ASM FILES

These are in the ASM directory, and can be assembled with Microsoft
or Turbo assemblers.  These modules are for use with TopSpeed
version 1.  (They could in principle also be used with TopSpeed version
3, if the "stack" calling convention is specified in the project file.
This however is not recommended, since better options exist with
this version of TopSpeed.)  It is conceivable that these modules
will also work for FST users, but I haven't yet got around to checking
for FST compatibility.

The present test status of these files is as follows:
    INNERKER.ASM:  Working with TopSpeed 1 and TopSpeed 3, not yet
        tested with FST.
    INNERK1.ASM, INNERK2.ASM, PARTEST.ASM:  Do not use these.
        The only purpose of these files is to act as a starting
        point for people who want to port PMOS to a new compiler.
    PLAYBUFF.ASM:  Working with TopSpeed 1 and TopSpeed 3, not yet
        tested with FST.
    MISCLIB.ASM:  not recently tested, so it could be out of date.

THE *.OBJ FILES

The OBJECT directory has separate subdirectories to hold the
assembled modules.  (I do it this way to reduce the likelihood of
people accidentally deleting files they're not in a position to
re-create.)
     OBJECT\TS1  Object files to use with TopSpeed version 1.
     OBJECT\TS3  Object files to use with TopSpeed version 3, for
         people who don't have the TopSpeed assembler.  This
         directory has several subdirectories, one for each
         supported memory model.

For people with TopSpeed version 3 including assembler, the recommended
approach is to run the MAKELIB batch file in the LIB directory
(N.B. First check the project files to ensure that they match your
preferences in terms of processor model, etc.); and from then on use
the *.LIB files and delete all the surplus object files in the
OBJECT directory.

For everyone else: take a look at the batch files and project files
in the LIB and OBJECT directories, and use these as a guide in deciding
how to set up your directories/projects.
