The program PP.EXE in this directory will customise some source files
to suit your compiler and other preferences.  Before running it, you
need to edit two files:

1. PP.FIL:  This contains a list of files to be processed.  You can
    leave this unchanged if your top-level directory is called PMOS.
    Otherwise you have to change directory paths for all files in the list.

2. PP.CFG:  This contains specifications of which compiler and which
    mouse you are using.  It is important to get the compiler
    specification correct - otherwise you'll find yourself with code
    that your compiler can't handle.  The mouse specification is less
    critical, except of course that modules that use a mouse could
    malfunction if there's a mismatch between your hardware and what
    the software assumes.  Note that MouseKind := NoMouse is a valid
    option.

Warning: although the FST compiler is mentioned in these directories,
support for FST is not yet properly in place.  You will probably
find that some (many?) modules in PMOS require alteration to
compile properly with FST.

If you have a compiler other than the ones mentioned, then you're on
your own.  The best approach is to specify a compiler which is
"closest" - in terms of the source language accepted - to the one
you have.  After that you'll have to use the compilation errors as a
guide to what needs to be changed to port PMOS to your compiler.
I do what I can to avoid non-portable code, but unfortunately every
Modula-2 compiler writer seems to have a slightly different notion
of what is standard.
