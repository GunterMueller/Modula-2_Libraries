-- If you are using a mouse, you have a choice of two mouse
-- drivers.  Setting MouseKind = INT33 makes the mouse software use
-- INT 33 calls to access a pre-loaded driver.  Otherwise it uses
-- the SerialMouse driver whose source code is part of PMOS.  (You
-- might need a bit of trial and error to decide which one works
-- best for you.)  Set MouseKind = NoMouse if you want mouse
-- support disabled regardless of whether your hardware supports
-- it.  Some good reasons for disabling mouse support might be
--     (a) you can't afford the processor time overhead, or
--     (b) incompatibilities between your hardware and the PMOS mouse
--         support are causing programs to malfunction.
-- Note: if you choose MouseKind = INT33 and your mouse driver was
-- supplied by Microsoft, you will probably need to specify
-- ChainTimerInt := TRUE (later in this file) in order to get around
-- a conflict between the mouse driver and the PMOS kernel; and you
-- might run into bugs even so.  A safer solution is to specify MS
-- rather than INT33, because I've had numerous problems with the
-- INT33/Microsoft combination.

-- MouseKind can have one of the following values:
--            NoMouse, INT33, MS, Logitech, PC

MouseKind := INT33

-- Mouse serial channel: COM1 or COM2.  This definition is
-- ignored if MouseKind is NoMouse or INT33.

MouseChannel := COM1

-- ChainTimerInt specifies that any pre-existing timer interrupt
-- routine should continue to be active while a PMOS program is running.
-- In most situations you should set it to FALSE, because there is
-- a performance hit.  You might however need this option in order to
-- avoid problems like mouse driver conflicts or network software 
-- being killed.
-- NOTE: The ChainTimerInt option works only if your compiler is
-- TopSpeed version 3.  I haven't yet worked out how to do this with
-- other compilers.
-- WARNING: in some situations, setting this option to TRUE results in
-- a program crash.  I haven't been able to discover the cause.

ChainTimerInt := TRUE

-- Do not alter the remaining lines in this file.  Several modules use
-- them to control what other modules they import from.
