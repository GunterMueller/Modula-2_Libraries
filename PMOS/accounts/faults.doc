FAULTS IN ACCOUNTS V2.2
=======================

Menus: use the improved facilities of module Menus.  I think this is working
  now, but needs more testing.

Second right mouse click after bringing up a menu selects the default
  menu item.  It would be better if it were ignored.

Block move: I've made a change for large blocks, but on reflection I
  think I did the wrong thing: the same number of records in total
  have to move whether we move a block or move things around it, so
  it may be more efficient to move the _bigger_ block to take advantage
  of large chunks.  (Note: the move works in either case, this is just
  an efficiency issue.)

Printing:
 - heading is a bit crude.
 - print to PRN seems to crash system.

Startup: can I improve speed?  It's a problem of opening all those
  files - no obvious way to avoid this.

Block move: Got a program hang (after the display was updated as expected!)
  on a move of a block from near the bottom of the display to the top
  line.  (Keyboard locked, i.e. got nothing but beeps from any key.)
  Happened only once, cannot now reproduce problem.  This is probably
  NOT fixed, because Marion has reported similar symptoms on some other
  operations.  Conjecture: could be due to error in a file operation
  - although an argument against this is that it looks as if the files
  are updated correctly.


DESIRABLE NEW FEATURES

Configuration options for international use.  It looks easy to
  allow for American dates, alternative money fields should be easy
  too, so it's mainly a matter of adding some "configure" procedures.
  Catch: we have to store the configuration options in a file
  somewhere.  For money, this would involve adding something to the
  header of each data file.  For dates too?  This seems like
  overkill, since it would be silly to have different formats for
  different files.

Note minor inelegancy: while marking a block, there's a perceptible
  time delay between scrolling and the colour reversal to mark the
  new section.  The speed penalty as such is minor, but the visual
  effect is disconcerting.  Possibly could be improved by doing the
  colour change at the time of scrolling - but this might require a
  significant change in the program logic.
