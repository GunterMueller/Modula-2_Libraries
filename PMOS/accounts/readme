                 README file for the Accounts program
                 ====================================

This program is shareware.  You are entitled to keep an unregistered
copy of the program for evaluation purposes, and to give copies of the
unregistered version to other people.  If you intend to keep using
the program, you should register it.  Registration details and
other conditions of use are explained later in this README document.

The function of the program is to keep track of your personal financial
accounts, for bank statement reconciliation, recording tax-deductible
items, and similar purposes.  There is also provision for remembering
when bills are due, and for making brief diary entries.


DISCLAIMER

Although the features provided by this program are sufficient for
personal account-keeping, you should not rely on it in situations
where loss or corruption of data would result in a financial loss.
There are some situations - for example, where account balances
become too large - where the program will fail.  You may use the
program only if you agree to accept its limitations.

The program is NOT intended for business use.  If you use it in the
course of running a business, you are violating the conditions of use.


INSTALLATION

To run the accounts program, you need the executable ACCOUNTS.EXE
and several data files.  It is suggested that you create directories
\ACCOUNTS and \ACCOUNTS\DATA, and set up the files as follows:

     \ACCOUNTS\ACCOUNTS.EXE
               The executable program.

     \ACCOUNTS\CONFIG.ACC
               A text file containing the names of the data files on
               which the program will operate.  A sample CONFIG.ACC is
               distributed with this program, but you will need to
               modify it to meet your own needs.

     \ACCOUNTS\MAINMENU.ACC    (optional)
               A text file which allows you to add items to the program's
               main menu.  This file is optional, i.e. the program will
               still work if it is missing.

     \ACCOUNTS\DATA\DIARY and \ACCOUNTS\DATA\BILLS.LGR
               A file of diary entries, and the "pending bills" file.
               These files may be missing from the distributed
               version; if so, the program creates them when it is
               first run.

You may choose different directory names if you wish; but the two
.ACC files must reside in the directory from which you run the program,
and this directory must have a subdirectory called DATA.

When you first run the program, or after you edit CONFIG.ACC, you are
likely to get startup messages saying that certain files are missing.
This is normal.  Any time you want to create a new data file, just
put its name into CONFIG.ACC (using a text editor) and let the program
create that file on startup.

If you subsequently decide not to use the program, you can de-install
it by deleting the directories \ACCOUNTS and \ACCOUNTS\DATA.


HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM

There is as yet no manual for the program.  (I might be talked into
producing a manual if enough people register.)  It should however be
self-explanatory since everything is menu-driven.

To select a menu item, you can use the cursor movement keys (Home, End,
PageUp, PageDown, and the four arrow keys) to move to the desired item.
Alternatively, you can type the first letter of the item name.  Once
you have selected an item, either the Enter key or space bar will
activate that item.

If using a mouse, a left click will select an item, and a left
click on an already-selected item will activate the item.  Because
of portability problems, mouse support is missing from the
unregistered version.

To leave a menu without selecting anything, use the Esc key.  If you
are partway through any operation (e.g. editing an entry), the Esc key
aborts the operation.  Throughout the program, Esc has the universal
meaning of "back out of the current operation".  The Esc key is also
what you use to terminate the program.  An alternative to Esc is a
left mouse click on the "close button" at the top right of a menu.

When viewing a data file, Enter or the space bar or a right mouse 
click will bring up a menu of operations which are legal at that 
time.  You will notice that you get a slightly different menu 
depending on where you are.

Many of the legal operations can also be activated by shortcut keys
without bringing up a menu.  In most cases the shortcut key is the
first letter of the corresponding menu item.  Special case: when
viewing a data file, the T key does a transfer _from_ the current
file, and the X key does a transfer _to_ the current file.  The
Insert and Delete keys work in what I hope is an intuitively obvious
way; and the Ctrl/K combination gives you a block operation.

You can add new transfer operations to the main menu by creating a
file called MAINMENU.ACC.  Each line in this file consists of three
items separated by commas: a text string, and two three-letter
abbreviations.  (The three-letter abbreviations are optional, the
commas are compulsory.)  The easiest way to see how this works is
to try it.


HOW TO REGISTER

Cost: $30 (Australian currency) if you want updates sent by e-mail
      or ftp.  Add $10 if you want a floppy disk sent to you
      (specify whether it's a 3.5" or 5.25" disk).

      [At the time of writing, $30 Australian is approximately
      equal to $20 US]

Where: see contact information below.

How: A personal cheque is OK if you have an Australian bank account.
     Otherwise use a bank cheque drawn on an Australian bank, an
     international money order, or similar.

Alternative method - from Europe only: send a Eurocheque, payable to
     Marion Gevers, for the amount of 700 Belgian francs (plus
     230 Belgian francs if you want a floppy disk).

When registering, specify your processor model (80286, 80386, or 80486)
and coprocessor (80287, 80387, or none).  This will let me put together
a tailored version that might run faster than the unregistered version.
If you want mouse support enabled, tell me what sort of mouse you have
and whether you're running under OS/2.

If you have special needs (processor model < 80286, messages in a
language other than English, etc.), let me know.  If the demand is
sufficient, I can create modified versions.

The registered version of the program is identical to the unregistered
version except for:
  - removal of the startup message saying that it's unregistered;
  - more data files allowed (100 rather than 10);
  - mouse support;
  - possibly faster, especially if you tell me you have a coprocessor.
