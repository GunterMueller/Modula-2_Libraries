CONST
    (* The following Boolean constant defines whether the PMOS kernel   *)

    (* priority.  For hard real-time applications this should typically *)
    (* be set to FALSE, since time-slicing interferes with the          *)
    (* predictability of execution times.  Disabling time-slicing also  *)
    (* reduces kernel overheads because of the following special        *)
    (* property: with time-slicing disallowed, the only tasks which     *)
    (* participate in task switches and in priority inheritance         *)
    (* calculations are those at the head of each ready queue.  (The    *)
    (* key theoretical result is that there is at most one "active"     *)
    (* task per priority level.)  With time-slicing enabled, any ready  *)
    (* task could be an active task.                                    *)
    (* For applications where keyboard/screen interaction is the        *)
    (* dominant factor, setting TimeSlicingEnabled TRUE sometimes gives *)
