DEFINITION MODULE KTrace;

	(****************************************************************)
	(*								*)
	(*	Trace routines for Modula 2 program development.	*)
	(*								*)
	(*  This is the version which does NOT use windows.  It is	*)
	(*  intended for low-level tracing of the kernel, where a	*)
	(*  window-based tracing facility would be unsuitable because	*)
	(*  of critical section problems.  However, it is quite		*)
	(*  adequate for any application where we don't care too much	*)
	(*  about a pretty screen layout.				*)
	(*								*)
	(*  Note, however, that this module is missing the "Press any	*)
	(*  key to continue" option which my other trace modules have.	*)
