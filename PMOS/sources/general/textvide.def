	(*		Low-level screen functions		*)
	(*							*)
	(*	The function of this module is to look after	*)
	(*	the low-level screen initialisation needed	*)
	(*	by the text-mode modules GlassTTY and Windows.	*)
	(*	This reduces the likelihood of conflicts	*)
	(*	arising in programs which import both of those	*)
	(*	modules.					*)

(*		WARNING		WARNING		WARNING			*)
(*									*)
(*  The operations performed by this module are among the rare examples	*)
(*  where a programming error can cause physical damage to the		*)
(*  hardware.  Do NOT attempt to modify anything in this module unless	*)
(*  you have a detailed understanding of how the video adaptors work.	*)
(*  In particular, beware of putting inappropriate values into the	*)
(*  registers of the 6845 video controller.				*)
(*									*)
(*  It is normal for the screen picture to "bloom" or "bounce" after	*)
(*  a mode change (e.g. changing from a text mode to a graphics mode).	*)
(*  Some monitors are worse than others for this, but all should	*)
(*  regain synchronism after a second or so.  A bright dot at the	*)
(*  centre of the screen or a "tearing" effect are NOT normal; if the	*)
(*  screen display goes crazy you should turn off the monitor and/or	*)
(*  reset the computer immediately, since it probably means that the	*)
(*  software is not compatible with your hardware.			*)
(*									*)
(*  The procedures in this module are for the use of other library	*)
(*  modules such as GlassTTY and Windows.  They should not normally	*)
(*  be called directly from applications programs.			*)
(*									*)
(*  DISCLAIMER: This software is supplied "as is" with no warranty as	*)
(*  to its compatibility with your hardware.  It has been tested on a	*)
(*  small sample of computers, but because of the wide variety of	*)
(*  video adaptors on the market it is impossible to be certain that	*)
(*  it will work correctly on all hardware configurations.		*)
