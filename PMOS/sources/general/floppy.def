	(*  Remark: This version supports only two drives, even	*)
	(*  though the controller hardware is capable of	*)
	(*  dealing with four drives.  I have actually tested	*)
	(*  the software with four drives, and there would be	*)

	(*  the module to handle the four-drive case; but I've	*)
	(*  never heard of any installation which has the four	*)
	(*  drives, so there seemed to be little point in	*)
	(*  retaining that feature.				*)
