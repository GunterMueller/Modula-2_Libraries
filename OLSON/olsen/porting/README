	    Modula-2 Preprocessor Porting Aides

This directory contains information and some modules to help
people who need to get the preprocessor running without an
existing preprocessor to bootstrap.  For more information, 
see the library manual.  You should already be familiar 
with the specifications of the preprocessor.

The module hackm2pp should be used in place of m2pp.  The
preprocessor control variables are defined in its initialization
body so that you don't have to port ProgArgs or ProgEnviron.
hack2mpp preprocesses standard input and writes the result to 
standard output.  (See HackTextIO below)

M2PParser and M2PScanner do not require many modules from the library.
You should probably keep it that way.  Specifically, they only use:

    CardConvert, Chars, GenConsts, IOConsts, NameLists,
    ProgErrOutput, SafeStorage, Strings, SYSTEM, SysTypes, TextIO

The modules GenConsts, IOConsts, and SysTypes, ProgErrOutput,
and SafeStorage do not need to be preprocessed since they will 
be very different on most implementations.  The other modules
merely define constants. Port these modules all of these modules 
first.   Note that you can remove the references to SafeStorage
for this particular application, but this is more work.

The modules Strings, CardConvert, and Chars are lightly used.
For the most part, they are used to construct error messages.  
You should be able to find a suitable equivalent in even the 
most paultry Modula-2 environments.

HackNameLists is a suitable substitute for NameLists for the
purposes of the modules M2PParser, M2PScanner, and hackm2pp.

The module TextIO is obviously the deepest into the library structure.
However, M2PScanner uses a select set of procedures from TextIO
which have been defined in the module HackTextIO in this directory.
If you want to port the library, you merely have to port HackTextIO
to your system.  This will give you the basis of what is required for
TextIO in any event and it will get the preprocessor running.

After you have ported the necessary files, copy the modules 
M2PParser and M2PScanner to your working directory and change
all references from NameLists to HackNameLists and TextIO
to HackTextIO.  If you haven't ported CardConvert, Chars,
and Strings, make the appropriate substitutions in the modules
HackNameLists, M2PParser, and M2PScanner. 

For your convenience, we have included a couple of test files
and sample output to detect bugs.  Copies these from the
tools test data directory.
