DEFINITION MODULE SysTypes;
(*
 * Defines system dependent values for generic types and system dependent
 * types.
 * 
 * The boolean constants littleEndian, bigEndian, littleEndianSets, and
 * bigEndianSets define the way data is stored in multi-byte/bit values.
 * These values are useful when dealing with network devices.  See their
 * declarations for more details.
 *
 * The types SAU and ANY aid address arithmetic and magic types SYSTEM.BYTE
 * and SYSTEM.WORD.  See their declarations for their specific meaning.
 * Three constants are associated with each of these types (XXX is ANY or SAU):
 *     bitsPerXXX - number of bits per storage location occupied by
 *         the declaration: VAR x : XXX;
 *     maxArrayIndexXXX - the largest value defined for the following
 * 	   declaration: ARRAY [ 0 .. maxArrayIndexXXX ] OF XXX;
 *
 * The generic types CARDINAL, BYTE, INTEGER, REAL, BITSET, and BOOLEAN
 * are described by constants defined here.  The prefixes for the
 * constants are (XXX is one of the above types):
 *      bitsPerXXX - as defined above.
 * 	maxArrayIndexXXX - as defined above.
 *      bitsPerArrayXXX - the number of bits per element of an ARRAY
 *         OF XXX.  This will be different from bitsPerXXX on some systems.
 * 	MINXXX - same as MIN( XXX ) 
 * 	MAXXXX - same as MAX( XXX )
 * For the type BITSET the values fullBITSET and emptyBITSET are defined
 * instead of MIN and MAX.
 *
 * The type REAL is more complex.  The following values are defined for it.
 *      minPosREAL - minimum positive (non-zero) real number.
 * 	minExponentREAL - largest base ten exponent.
 * 	maxExponentREAL - smallest base ten exponent.
 * 	maxDecimalDigitsREAL - largest number of significant digits
 *          in the mantissa.
 * 
 * The types Card, Int, and Real are defined for portability.  Some
 * Modula-2 implementations define CARDINAL, INTEGER, and REAL in a
 * way which would require duplicate effort in defining a library.
 * The new types are defined to carefully match the machine characteristics.
 * Specifically, Card and Int are the size of the machine ALU registers. 
 * Real is defined to be the most precise real which is "reasonable" to use.
 * Note reasonable does not mean "storage space conserving", but means
 * natural for the machine architecture.
 *
 * Some applications require storage space conservation.   Other applications
 * need to declare variables which occupy a specific amount of storage.  
 * For these applications, this module defines a set of "storage specific"
 * types.  A storage specific type is identified by its generic class
 * followed by a storage specification in bits.  For example, CARDINAL32
 * occupies 32 bits of storage and has the semantics of a CARDINAL number.
 * The semantic characteristics of the storage specific types are defined,
 * but the values bitsPer, bitsPerArray, and maxArrayIndex are typically
 * not defined.
 *
 * Comments about storage specific types:
 *      - A particular storage specific type may not exist in all
 *        implementations.   Therefore, portable applications should
 * 	  use them sparingly.
 *      - Although the basic (Modula-2) semantics of the type may
 * 	  exist, other modules may not handle the type.  A special
 *        procedure may be required to handle them.
 *	- The Modula-2 operations available for these types (+, -, etc.)
 *        may be supplied by a module, thus normal infix operations
 * 	  will not be possible.
 *      - If a specific range is required, use a subrange not a storage
 * 	  specific type.  Unless the compiler doesn't support the specific
 *        type.
 *
 * PORTABILITY NOTES:
 *      - When using bitsPerArrayXXX values, compute the number of
 * 	  XXX objects per SAU *before* multiplying by the number of
 * 	  array elements.   This will yield results proper for most
 * 	  systems that do data packing.
 *      - Use the types Card, Int, and Real when interfacing with the
 * 	  library and in other places as required.
 *      - If a module performs bitsPer arithmetic or makes assumptions
 * 	  about the size of any of the non-specific entities, include
 * 	  a check of the assumptions in the initialization body of the
 * 	  module.  Typically, these checks are under the control of the
 * 	  preprocessor variable SysTypesCheck.
 * 
 * This module specifies the system types for the following configurations:
 *     CPU      : Intel 88/86 family
 *     OS       : Dos 2.X, 3.X
 *     Compiler : Logitech 2.0/3.0
