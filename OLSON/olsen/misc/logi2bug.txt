    o If you get an error in a System.TermProcedure and the original
      termination was caused by a run-time system trap, then the
      machine will jump into outer-space.  The RTS needs to prepare
      for this event by fixing the stack inside CallTermProc.  We
      have done this at olsen and it is only a couple of lines of code.
    o This is a very strange bug:
	   TYPE
		File = POINTER TO FileRec;
		FilePtr = POINTER TO File;
	    VAR
		filePtr : FilePtr;
	    Open( filePtr^ ....
      Doesn't seem to work, but it will work if you do the call with a
      a temporary of type File and then do an assignment.
    o You can't have extra "|" values in your CASE statements.  This
      is a version 3 change.
14.6.87
    o The following construction seems to generate bad code:
	  procs[ varParameter ]( values[ varParameter ] );
      Basically, the program goes off into outer space. (varParameter
      is a varParameter.  procs is a global variable. values is an
      array within a pointer variable.  If you use a local variable
      instead of varParameter it seems to work.
    o You can't take the address of a variable which is declared as an
      opaque type.  Seems like you should be able to do that.
11.11.87
    o If you set your M2REF or M2MOD paths to a value greater than ~80 chars,
      the debuggers will hang when searching for files past the ~80 mark.
