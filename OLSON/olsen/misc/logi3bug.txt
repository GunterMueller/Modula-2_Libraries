Logitech 3.0 Compiler
8.8.88
    o The linker gets a fatal error when trying to link our largest program
      (aprox. 155 modules).  We couldn't get passed this, so we aren't using
      it any more.   Logitech 2.0 was able to link this, no problem.
16.9.88
    o Doesn't support SIZE as a pervasive identifier as Modula-2 3.0 should.
1.10.88
    o Can't have relative path names (i.e. ..\foo) in M2OBJ path.
    o DebugPMD doesn't handle dumps during termination code properly.
      It should generate a dump by another name instead of writing
      over the dump of the original error.
