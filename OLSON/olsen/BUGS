Bug Reports & Future Releases

The majority of the Library has been in daily use since mid 1987.  We
still find bugs which means so will you.  If you find a bug, please send 
us a description and the fix (if known) to:

    E-Mail: 
	mcvax!cernvax!unizh!olsen!yaml@uunet.uu.net
	olsen!yaml@uunet.uu.net
    
    P-Mail:
	Portable Modula-2 Library
	Olsen & Associates
	Seefeldstrasse 233
	CH-8008 Zurich
	Switzerland

We plan to have future releases when we have time.  The Library is 
constantly being augmented and improved.  Our internal application
base is large so we will not change established interfaces without
careful consideration.  If you are interested in the areas which
may change, see the file TODO.
